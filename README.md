The aim of the projet is to build an application that will retrieve the information of 42 student, using the 42 API. 
An API (Application programming interface) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. 
APIs often come in the form of a library that includes specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, and 
variables. In other cases, notably SOAP and REST services, an API is simply a specification of remote calls exposed to the API 
consumers.
